## Built personal portfolio site using html & css 

## I wanted to build a base portfolio site that I can use to showcase my work and skills. My goal was to create a template of what I want my page to look like, and build it from start to finish. I added the 2 projects I have worked on so far, and a couple examples of what I hope to complete in the future. I want this to serve as a continuing project as I learn more and finish more projects in the future. 


### Details explaining the steps I took

1. I sketched the layout of what I wanted my page to look like. I then started the project in github and added the necessary files I would need (html, css, .gitignore, readme). 

2. I started building the foundation of my layout in html. I used other pages as inspiration to help me figure out how I wanted my page put together. Once I knew what I was going to include, I started adding sections with divs in between my header and footer. I also used correct syntax to organize my code in the correct order. I was also adding comments on the way to explain what I was doing. 

3. I then started to style the body of the page and elements. I also created a images file in my css folder to bring in images I would be using. Then I started to add classes where I wanted to target specific elements of my page. 

4. I was then able to start styling each section of my project, starting with the header and making my way down. I also decided on the colors I would be using to make my page stand out and look good. I was also organizing my css in the correct order and adding comments on the way. 

5. Lastly, I made sure all links and images were responsive when interacted with. I also added media queries to make sure my page still responded well on different popular screenn sizes.
